## OBJECTIVE
The goal of this project is to create a gallery style webpage that displays the strengths and skills of all the students from the Web developer fast track Fall 2020 semester.  
Student information will be dynamically generated using a fetch to [this API](https://skulls-standings.herokuapp.com/api/v0/students/).
